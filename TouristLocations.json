    {"LocationName":"Taj Mahal","LocationLatitude":27.1751,"LocationLongitude":78.0421,"LocationDescription":"The Taj Mahal is one of the most famous vacation spots in the world, and with good reason! It’s one of the world’s Seven Wonders and it serves as a symbol of true, never-ending love. This mausoleum is, contrary to popular belief, not a palace – but the final resting place of Mumtaz Mahal, built by her husband for her. This architectural success is a prime example of the finest in Mughal architecture, with four completely identical sides over its 240-foot height. Its appearance shifts ever so slightly throughout the day with the sunlight, and you can see its reflection ripple in its huge pool beneath. Plus, stroll through the large garden outside for even more beautiful magnificence!"}
